Welcome, my name is FrantiÅ¡ek Malina and I am a software engineer,
entrepreneur and creator of Blocl, a community services directory and online room finder.
I build software and automate business processes and I train and advise people on how to do it.
Thanks to Unilexicon, I am a world renowned expert in knowledge organisation systems
and thanks to creating Unilexicon for Medicines I get to help pharmacists and pharma companies in their daily job.

When not getting some innocent adrenaline fix in the mountains I am working on my home
sometimes on web systems and software, typing into the terminal,text editor or consulting on the phone.

Working remotely, used to travel to stay near client sites.
I am Slovak/Moravian ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡° of origin, lived in England for 15 years and returned to Slovakia.
